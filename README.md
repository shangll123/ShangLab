# ShangLab
Lab resources for Shang lab members

## Group meetings
Our group meetings are held on Fridays from XXX PM to XXX PM. [link](https://github.com/shangll123/ShangLab/blob/main/GroupMeeting.md) <br>
The group meetings follow a structured format, alternating between: <br>
- Lab Meetings (LM): Trainees present their ongoing research, progress, and challenges. <br>
- Journal Clubs (JC): Trainees present and discuss recent papers from top journals. <br>
If you need to swap your presentation date, coordinate with another lab member in advance.<br>
For journal clubs, please:<br>
- Share the paper selection via [link](https://github.com/shangll123/ShangLab/blob/main/GroupMeeting.md).<br>
- (Optional) Include a review paper or relevant background material to provide proper context for all members.<br>
- Be prepared to give a comprehensive introduction before diving into the details of the paper.<br>

## Paper Review and Grant Writing
If you are considering an academic career in the US, please inform Lulu early on. We encourage lab members to:<br>
- Gain paper review experience by assisting in manuscript reviews.<br>
- Participate in grant writing opportunities to develop funding proposal skills.<br>
- Attend grant writing workshops and discuss strategies during lab meetings.<br>

## Weekly meeting
To maximize the effectiveness of our weekly 1-on-1 meetings, please review the meeting preparation guide (https://lulushang.org/blog/#meeting).

## Discussion and paper sharing
We use Slack as our primary platform for group discussions, collaboration, and general paper sharing.<br>
Important announcements, discussions, and relevant research papers will be shared in the appropriate Slack channels or through emails.<br>
Members are encouraged to actively participate, share papers, ask questions, and contribute to discussions.<br>
Zotero is also a good platform to share papers and take notes: https://www.zotero.org/groups/5897629/shanglab/library.
